We spoke to dozens of climate-change decision makers to get the most
comprehensive picture we could of data availability and
customizability. Our report covers the problems we addressed, our
research goals, profiles of our user groups, a summary of our
methods, and an in-depth discussion of our findings. It also
provides next steps — topics that would benefit from further research.

## What we found

* ### Planning for climate change
  Though climate-change planning varies from person to person and by
  location, the process typically involves four steps: a motivating
  event that spurs the planner to action, weighing the pros and cons
  of working with a science translator, deciding whether to work
  alone or partner with a translator, and then taking action.

* ### Reliance on federal resources
  One topic we researched in detail was which resources folks rely
  on as they plan for local climate change. We found that, while
  municipal analysts consult federal websites during the exploratory
  stages of planning, they use other resources to get more
  geographically granular data.

* ### Tailorability and findability
  Nearly all the municipal analysts we talked to noted that they’re
  not inherently opposed to using federal resources; rather, they’ve
  found that these resources aren’t as tailorable and easy to find
  as they’d like.

* ### Curation and production tools
  Currently, climate-change planners lack a single connecting
  website that helps them find locally relevant federal tools. For
  greatest success, such a site should provide locally relevant
  data, and should focus on curating resources rather than
  cataloguing everything that’s available.
