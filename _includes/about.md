## Hypothesis
### We believe that a SaaS procurement tool could …
* dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for an agency to acquire SaaS licenses and to increase/decrease the number of licenses used,
* show public servants some of the SaaS tools their colleagues use,
* clarify purchasing next steps,
* help move away from purchasing cards, and
* better inform SaaS purchasing decisions.


## Our approach
* The team is taking a ‘Wizard of Oz’ approach to initial development: a lightweight ordering interface, but a lot of manual work happening behind the scenes.
* Products and customers will be onboarded slowly instead of a ‘big bang’ approach.
