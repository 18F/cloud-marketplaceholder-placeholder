Now more than ever, decision makers in the federal government and
private industry need easy-to-find, locally relevant climate-change
data. Our research revealed that, while credible data are available,
they can be hard to find, and they may not be tailorable to specific
locations.

In partnership with [NOAA], [NASA], and the [White House’s
OSTP][OSTP], we explored what people are looking for in
climate-change data and how they set about finding it. We
interviewed folks across the country to get a comprehensive view of
how they approach the decision-making and data-gathering processes,
and we hope that our research inspires continued study.

Here, you’ll find a [report](#report) summarizing our findings,
detailed descriptions of our research methodologies, and ways you
