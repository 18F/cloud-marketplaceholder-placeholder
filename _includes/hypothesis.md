**A SaaS procurement tool could:**
- dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for an agency to acquire SaaS licenses and to increase/decrease the number of licenses used,
- show public servants some of the SaaS tools their colleagues use,
- clarify purchasing next steps,
- help move away from purchasing cards, and
- better inform SaaS purchasing decisions.
